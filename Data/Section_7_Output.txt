### San Diego Data Analysis

1. **Data Overview:**
   - The data file `sec7-2_San Diego_pri_sec_data.csv` contains information on three industries: Information, Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation, and Accommodation and Food Services.

2. **2019-2023 Change Calculation:**
   - The "2019-2023 Change" column seems to have incorrect values. Let's calculate the correct change for each industry:
     - Information: 2023 Jobs - 2019 Jobs = 31146 - 30385 = 761
     - Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation: 2023 Jobs - 2019 Jobs = 53662 - 56872 = -3210
     - Accommodation and Food Services: 2023 Jobs - 2019 Jobs = 182210 - 183576 = -1366

3. **2019-2023 % Change Calculation:**
   - Information: (761 / 30385) * 100 = 2.5%
   - Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation: (-3210 / 56872) * 100 = -5.6%
   - Accommodation and Food Services: (-1366 / 183576) * 100 = -0.7%

4. **Location Quotient (LQ) Change:**
   - Information: 2023 LQ - 2019 LQ = 0.8 - 0.9 = -0.1
   - Arts, Entertainment, and Recreation: 2023 LQ - 2019 LQ = 1.2 - 1.2 = 0.0
   - Accommodation and Food Services: 2023 LQ - 2019 LQ = 1.1 - 1.2 = -0.1
