Economic Scan Overview

This document is intended to assist in development of an MIQ-TNE prototype of the Economic Scan Report.


Breakdown and Anatomy of the Economic Scan Report

This section addresses each section of the report, including datasets powering each visualization and associated prompts and inputs.  When a dataset compares the target jurisdiction to the state and national data, the state data will be assigned an area id of ‘06’.  National data will be assigned an area id of ‘000’.

Datasets that compare the target jurisdiction to its peers will have an additional column ‘area_name’ that will easily identify the jurisdiction names.

The Gross Regional Product section produces one AI response and 1 visualization.
