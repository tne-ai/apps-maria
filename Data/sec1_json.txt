    "details": "The data shows a steady increase in San Diego County's GRP from 2019 to 2023, with a notable recovery post-2020. The Government sector consistently contributed the most to the GRP, followed by Manufacturing and Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services. The Accommodation and Food Services industry saw a decline in 2020 due to the pandemic but recovered in the following years. The GRP values were calculated based on industry contributions, and per capita GRP was derived by dividing total GRP by the population.",
    "recommendations": "To sustain economic growth, San Diego County should continue to support its key industries, particularly those that showed resilience and recovery post-pandemic. Diversifying the economy and investing in emerging sectors could also enhance economic stability.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The request for a GRP analysis was clear, and the data provided was sufficient to identify trends and key industry contributions. However, more detailed data on population changes and other economic factors could provide a deeper understanding of per capita GRP variations."
