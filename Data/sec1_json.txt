    "details": "The data shows San Diego County's GRP increased from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. Population figures decreased slightly from 3,330,458 in 2019 to 3,252,468 in 2023. GRP per capita was calculated by dividing total GRP by population for each year. The increase in GRP per capita suggests economic growth outpaced population growth, indicating improved productivity or higher-value economic activities.",
