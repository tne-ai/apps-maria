    "details": "The analysis uses data from 2019 to 2023, showing GRP and population figures for each year. The GRP per capita is calculated by dividing the total GRP by the population for each respective year. The GRP increased from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023, while the GRP per capita rose from $73,346.92 to $94,915.87. This reflects a 26.4% increase in total GRP and a 29.4% increase in GRP per capita over the five-year period.",
    "recommendations": "Consider leveraging the economic growth by investing in sectors that contributed to the GRP increase. Monitor population trends to ensure sustainable growth.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data provided is comprehensive for the years 2019 to 2023, but lacks specific sectoral contributions to the GRP, which could provide deeper insights into the drivers of economic growth."
