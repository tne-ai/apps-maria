    "subhead": "San Diego County's GRP grew from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023, with per capita GRP consistently above national averages.",
    "details": "The analysis uses GRP data from 2019 to 2023, showing a total increase of $64.43 billion. Annual growth rates were calculated using the formula: (GRP in current year - GRP in previous year) / GRP in previous year * 100. Per capita GRP was derived by dividing total GRP by the population. San Diego's per capita GRP was compared to California and national averages, showing higher values throughout the period.",
    "recommendations": "Continue monitoring economic indicators to sustain growth. Consider policies that support sectors contributing to GRP growth and address any potential economic challenges.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data provided is comprehensive, but the analysis could benefit from more granular data on sector contributions to GRP. Additionally, the impact of external economic factors on growth rates could be further explored."
