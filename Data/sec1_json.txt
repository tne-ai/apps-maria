    "subhead": "San Diego County's GRP grew by 26.4% from 2019 to 2023, with significant contributions from government and professional services. The per capita GRP increased, surpassing state and national averages.",
    "details": "The analysis uses GRP data from 2019 to 2023, showing a growth from $244.28 billion to $308.71 billion. Per capita GRP calculations are based on total GRP divided by population estimates. Industry contributions in 2023 highlight the Government sector at $52.92 billion, followed by Professional Services at $37.04 billion. The data reflects a rebound post-2020 pandemic impacts, with San Diego's per capita GRP exceeding California's average of $93,800 and the national average of $77,366.",
    "recommendations": "Consider investing in sectors like Professional Services and Manufacturing, which show strong growth potential. Monitor economic policies that support these industries to sustain growth.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The request for a GRP report is clear, but the data lacks specific population figures for precise per capita calculations for years 2020-2022. Assumptions were made based on available data."
