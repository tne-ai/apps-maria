    "details": "The analysis is based on data from `sec1-2_San Diego County_per_capita_grp_data.csv` and `sec1-1_San Diego County_grp_data.csv`. The GRP and GRP per capita values are calculated annually. Yearly growth rates are computed using the formula: ((GRP of current year - GRP of previous year) / GRP of previous year) * 100. State and national GRP per capita data are used for comparison.",
