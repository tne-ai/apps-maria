### Analysis

#### 1. Year-over-Year Change in Number of Firms

From the `sec6-3_San Diego County_firms_yoy_data.csv`:

- **2021**: 65,178 firms
- **2022**: 68,078 firms

**Calculation**: 
The year-over-year change in the number of firms is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Change} = \frac{\text{Firms in 2022} - \text{Firms in 2021}}{\text{Firms in 2021}} \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Change} = \frac{68,078 - 65,178}{65,178} \times 100 \approx 4.45\%
\]

This indicates a 4.45% increase in the number of firms from 2021 to 2022.

#### 2. Per Capita Firms

From the `sec6-2_San Diego County_firms_percap_data.csv`:

- **2021**: 0.019901958928278077
- **2022**: 0.020779510946801912

**Calculation**:
The change in per capita firms is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Change in Per Capita Firms} = \frac{\text{Per Capita Firms in 2022} - \text{Per Capita Firms in 2021}}{\text{Per Capita Firms in 2021}} \times 100
\]

\[
\text{Change} = \frac{0.020779510946801912 - 0.019901958928278077}{0.019901958928278077} \times 100 \approx 4.41\%
\]

This indicates a 4.41% increase in per capita firms from 2021 to 2022.
