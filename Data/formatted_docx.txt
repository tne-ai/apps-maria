            "content": "To generate the San Diego County's Gross Regional Product (GRP) report, we will analyze the provided data from the CSV files, focusing on the GRP data for San Diego County, California, and the United States from 2019 to 2023. The analysis will examine both the total GRP in dollars and the GRP per capita for each year.\n\nSan Diego County's total GRP increased steadily from approximately $244 billion in 2019 to $309 billion in 2023. This growth is reflected in the GRP per capita, which rose from $73,347 in 2019 to $94,916 in 2023. California, the broader economic context, also experienced significant growth, with its total GRP rising from about $2.99 trillion in 2019 to $3.65 trillion in 2023. The state's GRP per capita increased from $75,789 to $93,800 over the same period. Similarly, the United States saw an increase in total GRP from approximately $20.93 trillion in 2019 to $25.96 trillion in 2023, with the GRP per capita growing from $63,754 to $77,366.\n\nOverall, San Diego County's economic performance, as measured by GRP, has been strong, with significant growth in both total output and per capita output over the past five years. This trend is consistent with the broader economic growth observed in California and the United States.",
