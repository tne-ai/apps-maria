In 2019, the GRP was approximately $244.28 billion, and by 2023, it had increased to about $308.71 billion. This marks a total growth of approximately $64.43 billion over the five-year span. The annual growth rates varied, with a modest increase of $0.54 billion from 2019 to 2020, followed by a more substantial rise of $24.05 billion from 2020 to 2021. The growth continued with an increase of $27.81 billion from 2021 to 2022, and a further $12.03 billion from 2022 to 2023. This steady increase in GRP highlights the resilience and expansion of the region's economy.\n\nIn terms of economic productivity per person, the per capita GRP also saw a significant rise. In 2019, the per capita GRP was approximately $73,347, which increased to about $94,916 by 2023. This growth indicates an enhancement in economic productivity per individual over the period. Notably, San Diego County's per capita GRP consistently surpassed the national average throughout these years. In 2023, the county's per capita GRP was higher than both the state average of $93,800 and the national average of $77,366.\n\nThe economic growth in San Diego County can be attributed to key industries such as Government, Professional, Scientific, and Technical Services, and Manufacturing.
