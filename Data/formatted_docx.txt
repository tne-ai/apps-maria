The analysis will focus on GRP trends from 2019 to 2023, comparing it with state and national data.\n\nThe Gross Regional Product (GRP) is a measure of the economic output of a region, similar to the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but at a regional level. The GRP data for San Diego County from 2019 to 2023 provides valuable insights into the county's economic performance over these years. In 2019, the GRP was $244.28 billion, increasing to $308.71 billion by 2023, a consistent upward trend. Per capita GRP also showed significant growth, rising from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023, indicating that economic growth outpaced population growth.\n\nThe yearly growth rates reveal a strong economic recovery and expansion. From 2019 to 2020, the GRP increased by a modest 0.22%, reflecting a stable period. However, the following years saw substantial growth: a 9.82% increase from 2020 to 2021, a 10.34% rise from 2021 to 2022, and a 4.06% growth from 2022 to 2023. These figures demonstrate the county's resilience and capacity for economic expansion.",

            "content": "When compared to state and national data, San Diego County's economic performance is notable. The state of California's GRP per capita increased from $75,788.64 in 2019 to $93,799.67 in 2023, aligning closely with San Diego County's trend, though slightly lower in absolute terms. Nationally, the GRP per capita grew from $63,753.57 in 2019 to $77,366.43 in 2023, making San Diego County's GRP per capita consistently higher than the national average, a testament to its stronger economic performance.\n\nIn conclusion, San Diego County has experienced robust economic growth from 2019 to 2023, with both total GRP and GRP per capita increasing significantly.
