            "content": "The Gross Regional Product (GRP) of San Diego County has shown a remarkable trajectory of growth from 2019 to 2023. In 2019, the total GRP was approximately $244.28 billion. Despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP slightly increased to $244.82 billion in 2020. This resilience set the stage for a significant recovery and growth phase in 2021, with the GRP rising to $268.87 billion. The upward trend continued in 2022, reaching $296.68 billion, and further increased to $308.71 billion in 2023. This consistent growth reflects the region's robust economic recovery and expansion over the five-year period. Alongside the total GRP, the per capita GRP also demonstrated a positive trend. Starting at approximately $73,347 in 2019, it saw a slight increase to $74,278 in 2020. The following years marked notable growth, with per capita GRP climbing to $82,100 in 2021, $90,557 in 2022, and reaching $94,916 in 2023. This increase in per capita GRP indicates not only economic growth but also improved productivity and prosperity for the residents of San Diego County.",
