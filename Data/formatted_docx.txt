Despite the economic challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP slightly increased to $244.82 billion in 2020. This resilience was followed by a significant recovery in 2021, with the GRP rising to $268.87 billion. The growth continued in 2022, reaching $296.68 billion, and further increased to $308.71 billion in 2023. This consistent growth reflects the region's robust economic recovery and expansion over the five-year period. Alongside the total GRP, the per capita GRP also demonstrated a positive trajectory. Starting at approximately $73,347 in 2019, it increased slightly to $74,278 in 2020. The following years saw more substantial growth, with per capita GRP reaching $82,100 in 2021, $90,557 in 2022, and $94,916 in 2023.

            "content": "The performance of various industries in San Diego County over these years further illustrates the region's economic dynamics. The Accommodation and Food Services industry experienced fluctuations, with a downturn in 2020 due to the pandemic, followed by recovery and growth in the subsequent years. The Administrative and Support and Waste Management and Remediation Services sector showed consistent growth, as did the Agriculture, Forestry, Fishing, and Hunting industry, which steadily increased its GRP contribution.

The Construction industry demonstrated consistent growth throughout the period, while the Finance and Insurance sector experienced significant growth, particularly in 2020 and 2021. The Government sector remained the largest contributor to the GRP, with steady growth each year. Health Care and Social Assistance reflected the increasing demand for healthcare services with consistent growth. The Information sector saw notable growth, especially in 2021 and 2022.
