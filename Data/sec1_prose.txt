To generate the San Diego County's Gross Regional Product (GRP) report, we will analyze the provided data from the `sec1-2_San Diego County_per_capita_grp_data.csv` and `sec1-1_San Diego County_grp_data.csv` files, focusing on GRP trends from 2019 to 2023, both in total dollars and per capita. 

San Diego County's total GRP has shown a consistent increase over the years, growing from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. This robust economic expansion is further reflected in the per capita GRP, which rose from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023, indicating that the economic growth outpaced population growth.

Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, San Diego County's GRP did not decline; instead, it saw a slight increase from the previous year. This resilience was followed by substantial growth in both total GRP and per capita GRP in the subsequent years, with the most significant increases occurring between 2020 and 2021, and continuing through 2023.

These trends highlight the county's strong economic performance and its ability to recover and grow even in the face of global challenges. The consistent increase in both total GRP and per capita GRP is indicative of a healthy and expanding economic environment in San Diego County.
