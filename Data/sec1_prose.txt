To generate the San Diego County's Gross Regional Product (GRP) report, we will analyze the provided data from the CSV files, focusing on the GRP data for San Diego County, California, and the United States from 2019 to 2023. The analysis will examine both the total GRP in dollars and the GRP per capita for each year.

San Diego County's total GRP has shown a consistent increase from 2019 to 2023, growing from approximately $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. This robust growth indicates a strong economic performance over the five-year period. The GRP per capita has also improved significantly, rising from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023, suggesting that the economic output per person has increased, reflecting higher productivity and economic prosperity.

The yearly growth rates reveal interesting trends. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP remained relatively stable from 2019 to 2020, with only a slight increase. However, there was a notable recovery and growth phase from 2020 to 2021, with significant rises in both total GRP and GRP per capita. This growth continued in 2021 to 2022, and the upward trend persisted into 2023, with the highest GRP per capita recorded that year.

San Diego County's consistent economic growth over the past five years underscores the county's resilience and ability to adapt to economic challenges. The rise in GRP per capita also highlights improvements in productivity and living standards for its residents.
