San Diego County has demonstrated robust economic growth over the past five years, with both total Gross Regional Product (GRP) and GRP per capita showing significant increases. From 2019 to 2023, the total GRP grew from approximately $244.28 billion to $308.71 billion, representing a 26.4% increase. This growth is even more pronounced when examining GRP per capita, which rose from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023, marking a 29.4% increase. The GRP saw a steady increase each year, with the most significant jump occurring between 2021 and 2022, where the total GRP increased by approximately $27.81 billion, and the per capita GRP increased by $8,457.15.

Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, San Diego County's GRP managed to grow slightly from 2019 to 2020, indicating economic resilience. The population of San Diego County slightly decreased from 3,330,458 in 2019 to 3,252,468 in 2023, which may have contributed to the increase in GRP per capita as the total GRP continued to rise. This steady rise in GRP per capita suggests improvements in productivity and economic output per resident, which is a positive indicator for the region's economic health.
