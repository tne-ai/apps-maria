To generate the San Diego County's Gross Regional Product (GRP) report, we will analyze the provided data from the CSV files, focusing on the GRP data for San Diego County, California, and the United States from 2019 to 2023. The analysis will examine both the total GRP in dollars and the GRP per capita for each year.

San Diego County's total GRP has shown a consistent increase from 2019 to 2023, growing from approximately $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. This robust growth indicates strong economic performance over these years. Similarly, the GRP per capita has also increased significantly, rising from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023, suggesting that the economic output per person in San Diego County has improved, potentially leading to higher standards of living.

The yearly growth rates reveal a nuanced economic trajectory. Despite the challenges posed by the COVID-19 pandemic, the GRP remained relatively stable from 2019 to 2020, with only a slight increase. However, there was a notable recovery and growth phase from 2020 to 2021, marked by a significant rise in both total GRP and GRP per capita. This growth continued in 2021 to 2022, with another significant rise in both metrics. The upward trend persisted into 2022 to 2023, with the GRP per capita nearing $95,000.

San Diego County's consistent economic growth reflects the county's resilience and ability to recover from economic disruptions. The steady rise in GRP per capita suggests improvements in productivity and economic well-being for the residents of San Diego County.
