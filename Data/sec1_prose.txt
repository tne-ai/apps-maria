To generate the San Diego County's Gross Regional Product (GRP) report, we analyzed data from the `sec1-2_San Diego County_per_capita_grp_data.csv` and `sec1-1_San Diego County_grp_data.csv` files, focusing on GRP trends from 2019 to 2023, both in total dollars and per capita. The total GRP showed a consistent increase over the years, rising from $244.28 billion in 2019 to $308.71 billion in 2023. The most significant year-over-year increase occurred between 2021 and 2022, with a jump of approximately $27.81 billion. Similarly, GRP per capita also demonstrated steady growth, increasing from $73,346.92 in 2019 to $94,915.87 in 2023. The largest year-over-year increase in GRP per capita was from 2021 to 2022, with an increase of $8,457.15.

Despite a slight decline in population—from 3,330,458 in 2019 to 3,252,468 in 2023—the economic output per resident continued to rise, indicating enhanced productivity and efficiency. This data suggests a robust and healthy economic environment in San Diego County, characterized by significant gains in economic output per resident.
