    "details": "The analysis uses data from San Diego and San Diego County, focusing on job numbers, percentage changes, and location quotients for 2019 and 2023. Calculations include job change (2023 Jobs - 2019 Jobs) and percentage change ((Change in Jobs / 2019 Jobs) * 100). Location quotient changes are calculated as (2023 Location Quotient - 2019 Location Quotient).",
    "recommendations": "Consider strategies to support declining sectors like Arts and Accommodation, and leverage growth in Transportation and Warehousing for economic development.",
    "request_and_response_issues": "The data does not specify the reasons behind job changes or location quotient shifts, which could provide deeper insights into industry dynamics."
